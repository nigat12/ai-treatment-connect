       "  'Brief Summary': \"This phase III trial compares the effect of adding stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the usual treatment (conventional image guided radiation therapy \\\\[IGRT\\\\] and chemotherapy followed by immunotherapy with durvalumab or osimertinib) versus the usual treatment alone in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) and cannot be treated by surgery (inoperable). SBRT uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. IGRT is a type of radiation that uses a computer to create a picture of the tumor, to help guide the radiation beam during therapy, making it more accurate and causing less damage to healthy tissue. Usual chemotherapy used in this trial consists of combinations of the following drugs: cisplatin, carboplatin, paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, pemetrexed, and etoposide. Cisplatin and carboplatin are in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. Cisplatin works by killing, stopping, or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Carboplatin works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping, or slowing the growth of tumor cells as well. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It works by stopping the growth and spread of tumor cells. Nab-paclitaxel is an albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel which may have fewer side effects and work better than other forms of paclitaxel. Pemetrexed is in a class of medications called antifolate antineoplastic agents. It works by blocking the action of a certain substance in the body that may help tumor cells multiply. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair and may kill tumor cells. Immunotherapy with durvalumab, may induce changes in the body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Osimertinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of a protein called EGFR that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of tumor cells. Adding SBRT to the usual treatment of IGRT with chemotherapy and immunotherapy may be more effective at treating patients with locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer than giving the usual treatment alone.\",\n",

       "  'Brief Summary': \"This phase III trial compares standard therapy given after surgery (adjuvant) to standard therapy given before and after surgery (perioperative) in treating patients with stage II-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that can be removed by surgery (resectable). The usual approach for patients with resectable NSCLC is chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy before surgery, after surgery, or both before and after surgery. This study is being done to find out which approach is better at treating patients with lung cancer. Treatment will be administered according to the current standard of care at the time of enrollment. Chemotherapy options may include cisplatin, carboplatin, pemetrexed, gemcitabine, docetaxel, and vinorelbine at standard doses according to the treating physician. Cisplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Pemetrexed is in a class of medications called antifolate antineoplastic agents. It works by stopping cells from using folic acid to make deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may kill tumor cells. Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug that blocks the cells from making DNA and may kill tumor cells. Docetaxel is in a class of medications called taxanes. It stops tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Other chemotherapy drugs, such as vinorelbine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading . Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Starting treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy prior to surgery and continuing treatment after surgery may be a more effective treatment option than adjuvant therapy alone in patients with stage II-IIIB resectable NSCLC.\",\n",

These brain tumors are typically treated by surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, either individually or in combination. Present therapies are inadequate, as evidenced by the low 5-year survival rate for brain cancer patients, with median survival at approximately 12 months. Glioma is the most common form of primary brain cancer, afflicting approximately 7,000 patients in the United States each year. These highly malignant cancers remain a significant unmet clinical need in oncology. GBM often has a high expression EFGR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) which is blocked by Cetuximab (CTX). The investigators have recently completed a separate Phase I clinical trial using superselective intra-arterial cerebral infusion (SIACI) of CTX after blood brain barrier disruption (BBBD) for recurrent GBM (Chakraborty et al, in revision, Journal of Neurooncology). The investigators found that intra-arterial infusion of CTX is well tolerated with few adverse effects. The investigators hypothesize that in patients with newly diagnosed GBM, repeated SIACI of this drug after BBBD will be safe and efficacious for our patients when combined with standard chemoradiation (STUPP protocol).\\n\\nThis trial will be a non-randomized open label Phase I/II clinical trial.
