MRI scans are used to monitor the possible spread of the cancer with an MRI machine over time. PCI is radiation therapy that is delivered to the brain in hopes of preventing spread of cancer into the brain. The use of brain MRI alone may reduce side effects of receiving PCI and prolong patients' lifespan. Monitoring with MRI scans alone (delaying radiation until the actual spread of the cancer) may be at least as good as the combination of PCI with MRI scans.\n",

ADCs are designed to stick to cancer cells and kill them. This clinical trial also uses a drug called docetaxel. Docetaxel is an anticancer drug that has been approved to treat non-small cell lung cancer. It is usually given to patients who previously received another anticancer treatment. In this study, one group of participants will get sigvotatug vedotin on Days 1 and 15 during each 28-day-cycle. A second group of participants will get docetaxel on Day 1 during each 21-day cycle.\\n\\nThis study is being done to see if sigvotatug vedotin works better than docetaxel to treat participants with NSCLC.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
